# Frogger 3D

## Description

This is a simple 3D version of Frogger implemented in WebGL. To move Frogger, use the WASD keys. Buses and
bikes will kill Frogger if they hit him and Frogger will drown if he goes in the water, but you can jump on logs
to avoid the water. Get into the green square to win; win three times in a row, and the level will get harder.

## Extra Credit

(2%) Track and display score:
The score is displayed as a streak.

(3%) When a certain number of frogs cross the road and river safely, a new level appears:
Getting a streak of 3 will cause a new level to load with new logs and faster cars.

(4%) Add at least one additional vehicle:
A sneaky biker will occasionally ride through the bank between the road and the river. He is faster than
the cars and harder to see, but has a smaller hitbox.

Total Extra Credit: 9%
